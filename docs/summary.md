6. Which tasks you used Claude/Codex for
- I've used copilot, because the others are paid
7. What output you accepted or modified
- didn't accepted all suggesstions but most of them. Some of them required modifications, for example - expected output when testing endpoints
8. How AI affected your speed or code quality
- improved the speed
9. What custom settings have you made (if any)
- not so much, I've followed copilot 
10. What problems you`ve handled during the development
